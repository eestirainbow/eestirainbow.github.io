                    In Canada, there are to be three logistics academies. One near Kingston on Lake Ontario, midway
                    between Ottawa and Toronto. Another near Niagara Falls, close to Lake Erie and the city of Saint
                    Catherines.
                    The rural area around Nicolet includes the N-PLAN logistics site in Quebec Province, near the Quebec
                    National Police Academy and another school (Ecole agriculture de Nicolet).

                    Since 1952, a weapons-testing center (belonging to the Canadian armed forces) is adjacent to Lake
                    Saint Pierre and the Nicolet River.

                    Both Nicolet and the nearby city of Trois Rivieres [on the Saint Maurice River where it joins the
                    Saint Lawrence River] are midway between Montreal and Quebec City.

                <p class="wow fadeIn">
                    How many people are needed to support one NATO pilot or one NATO sailor or one NATO soldier? The
                    answer is five people. So every group of 100 fighters in military uniform depend on 500 persons for
                    their complete support in combat, in
                    training and as North
                    Atlantic Treaty Organization peacekeepers.

                <p class="wow fadeIn">
                    That is the mission of NATO Peacekeepers Academies: to prepare support personnel required by NATO,
                    in a three-year-educational-program beginning with girls and boys at the age of 16 who have
                    completed the ninth grade of school. This is
                    nothing less than
                    professional education—new academies in Europe and North America for professionals, educated by and
                    for NATO.

                <p class="wow fadeIn">
                    Deutschland made two kinds of contributions to NATO in Year 2017: Deutschland paid (in cash) $
                    242,018,000 of the total NATO annual headquarters budget that was $1,652,000,000.
                </p>
                <p class="wow fadeIn">
                    Deutschland also made a second contribution to NATO in the same year, 2017; not in cash. The second
                    contribution was in personnel and equipment. This contribution was calculated to have a certain
                    dollar value.
                </p>
                <p class="wow fadeIn">
                    The dollar value of the second contribution was compared to the total dollar value called Gross
                    Domestic Product or GDP.
                    The dollar value of Deutschland's donated personnel and equipment becomes a ratio compared with GDP,
                    and finally there is a percentage--which is less than two percent.
                </p>
                <p class="wow fadeIn">
                    There is a pledge, a promise, that Deutschland will reach the two-percent level for its second
                    contribution [ personnel and equipment ] by the Year 2024.
                    Deutschland can fund "distance learning," focusing on military logistics in the morning (from
                    Frankfort ) and military academics for Grades 10, 11 and 12 in the afternoon ( from Bonn ).
